Routing Information Protocol -

The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols, which employs the hop count as a routing metric. It is an Open Standard Routing Protocol. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from the source to a destination. The maximum number of hops allowed for RIP is 15. This hop limit, however, also limits the size of networks that RIP can support. A hop count of 16 is considered an infinite distance, in other words the route is considered unreachable. RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.
Originally, each RIP router transmitted full updates every 30 seconds. In most current networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS (the latter two being link-state routing protocols), and a hop limit severely limits the size of network it can be used in. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters on a router unlike other protocols.
RIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved port number 520. Rip has two versions- RIPv1 and RIPv2, running on Ipv4 and RIPng running on Ipv6.


RIP version 1 (RIPv1) -

The original specification of RIP, defined in RFC 1058, was published in 1988 and uses classful routing. The periodic routing updates do not carry subnet information, lacking support for variable length subnet masks (VLSM). This limitation makes it impossible to have different-sized subnets inside of the same network class. In other words, all subnets in a network class must have the same size. There is also no support for router authentication, making RIP vulnerable to various attacks. RIPv1 uses Broadcast IP 255.255.255.255 for communication.


RIP version 2 (RIPv2) -

Due to the deficiencies of the original RIP specification, RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed in 1993 and last standardized in 1998. It included the ability to carry subnet information, thus supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). To maintain backward compatibility, the hop count limit of 15 remained. RIPv2 has facilities to fully interoperate with the earlier specification if all Must Be Zero protocol fields in the RIPv1 messages are properly specified. In addition, a compatibility switch feature allows fine-grained interoperability adjustments.
In an effort to avoid unnecessary load on hosts that do not participate in routing, RIPv2 multicasts the entire routing table to all adjacent routers at the address 224.0.0.9, as opposed to RIPv1 which uses broadcast. Unicast addressing is still allowed for special applications. (MD5) authentication for RIP was introduced in 1997. RIPv2 is Internet Standard STD56 (which is RFC 2453). Route tags were also added in RIP version 2. This functionality allows a distinction between routes learned from the RIP protocol and routes learned from other protocols.

RIP next generation (RIPng) -

RIPng (RIP next generation), defined in RFC 2080,[7] is an extension of RIPv2 for support of IPv6, the next generation Internet Protocol. The main differences between RIPv2 and RIPng are:

    Support of IPv6 networking.
    While RIPv2 supports RIPv1 updates authentication, RIPng does not. IPv6 routers were, at the time, supposed to use IPsec for authentication.
    RIPv2 encodes the next-hop into each route entry, RIPng requires specific encoding of the next hop for a set of route entries.


RIPng sends updates on UDP port 521 using the multicast group FF02::9.


For implementing RIP protocol between two routers, we can use any of the network simulation tools available -

    Packet Tracer
    GNS
    NFS


Packet Tracer -

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation program that allows us to experiment with network behavior. Packet Tracer provides simulation, visualization, authoring, assessment, and collaboration capabilities and facilitates the teaching and learning of complex technology concepts.

Packet Tracer supplements physical equipment by allowing us to create a network with an almost unlimited number of devices, encouraging practice, discovery, and troubleshooting.


Commands for implementing RIP between two routers

hostname – This command is used to change the name of a router.

interface – This command is used to assign IP address to an interface.

router rip – This command enables a RIP routing process, which places us in router configuration mode.
network – This command associates a network with a RIP routing process.
